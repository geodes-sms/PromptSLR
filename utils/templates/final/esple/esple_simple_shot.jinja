You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) that have used empirical studies with human intervention. Software product lines aim to support the development of a family of software products through the systematic reuse of shared assets and handle variability in software. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the TITLE, ABSTRACT as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

{% if "shots" in json.configurations and json.configurations.shots.positive > 0 +%}
I give {{json.configurations.shots.positive}} examples that should be included.
{%+ for article in data.positiveShots %}
{%+ for k, v in article.items() %}
{{k | upper}}: {{v}}
{%+ endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
