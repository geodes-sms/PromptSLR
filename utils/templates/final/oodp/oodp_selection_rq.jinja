You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on identifying language features claimed to improve object-oriented design pattern implementations, what measures are used to evaluate these improvements, and what empirical data was collected to assess these improvements. Language features include, among others, meta-programming, aspect-oriented programming, reflection, reactive programming, signals, functional programming, case classes, closures, immutability, Chameleon objects, class extension, default implementation, extended initialization, mixins, object interaction styles, and sub-classing. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the TITLE, ABSTRACT as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Evaluate if the article helps answer the research questions:
1. What language features have been suggested to improve design pattern implementations?
2. Which design patterns have the most associated language feature suggestions? 
3. What measures have been used to evaluate the impact of these language features on design pattern implementations?
4. What experiments have been done on these language features?

Exclude if:
1. The article is not in software engineering
2. The article is not related to improving design patterns and it is not proposing a language feature to do so.
3. The article is exclusively related to measuring the impact of existing design patterns against non-pattern code.
4. The article is related to at least one specific design patterns.

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
