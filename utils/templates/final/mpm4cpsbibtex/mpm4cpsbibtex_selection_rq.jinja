You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on multi-paradigm modeling approaches and applications to model cyber-physical systems. Multi-paradigm modeling combines reusable modular modeling languages with different paradigms instead of using a single monolithic language for the whole system. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate computation, networking, and physical processes. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the TITLE, ABSTRACT as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Evaluate if the article helps answer the research questions:
1. What multi-paradigm modeling approaches exist for CPS? 
2. How are multi-paradigm modeling approaches for building CPS presented? 
3. What CPS application domains have been modeled? 
4. What is the profile of the person who performs CPS modeling?

Exclude if:
1. The article is not related to multi-paradigm modeling approaches and applications to model CPS.
2. The article is falling under purely hardware or electrical engineering domains. 
3. The article does not explicitly mention theÂ modeling of CPS.
4. The article does not report a methodology, metric, or formalism for modeling of CPS.
5. The article does not analyze relevant application domains for modeling CPS.

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
