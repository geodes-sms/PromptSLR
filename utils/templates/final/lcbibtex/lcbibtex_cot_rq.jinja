You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on domain-specific modeling language (DSML) composition. This SLRÂ investigates approaches and techniques for composing heterogeneous domain-specific modeling languages. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the BIBTEX as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Follow these steps when making your decisions:
1. Determine the topic relevance:
Is the article related to DSMLs and their composition? Does the article address the composition of non-modeling languages?
2. Evaluate if the article helps answer the research questions:
    What are the trends of DSML composition in the literature? 
    What are the characteristics of DSML composition techniques? 
    What tool support is there for DSML composition? 
    How are the DSML composition approaches applied? 
    What are the challenges and limitations of DSML composition?
3. Check the type of study: 
Is the article at least 4 pages long? Is it in the software engineering domain?
4. Assess the quality of the study: 
Does the article use or present a modeling language composition technique?
5. Make a decision: 
Based on the above criteria, should the article be included in the SLR?

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
