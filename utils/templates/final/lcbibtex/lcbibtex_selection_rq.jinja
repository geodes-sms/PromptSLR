You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on domain-specific modeling language (DSML) composition. This SLRÂ investigates approaches and techniques for composing heterogeneous domain-specific modeling languages. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the TITLE, ABSTRACT as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Evaluate if the article helps answer the research questions:
1. What are the trends of DSML composition in the literature? 
2. What are the characteristics of DSML composition techniques? 
3. What tool support is there for DSML composition? 
4. How are the DSML composition approaches applied? 
5. What are the challenges and limitations of DSML composition?

Exclude if:
The article is not related to DSMLs and their composition.
The article does not address the composition of non-modeling languages.
The article is not in the software engineering domain.
The article does not use or present a modeling language composition technique.

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
